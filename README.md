# Secure Logging Compliance Document

## Overview

This document provides detailed logging requirements and controls for organizations handling sensitive data. Integrating best practices from major standards including **ISO/IEC 27001**, **NIST**, **PCI-DSS**, **HIPAA**, **SOC 2**, **GDPR**, **CIS**, and **SANS**, it covers essential practices for secure log management to ensure compliance, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## 1. Logging Controls by Standard

### ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002
- **Data Integrity and Confidentiality**: Use encryption and access controls to protect log integrity and confidentiality.
- **Access Management**: Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict log access to authorized users.
- **Log Retention**: Establish policies to retain logs based on regulatory and organizational requirements.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Regularly review and audit logs to detect anomalies or security breaches.

### NIST SP 800-92 (Log Management) and SP 800-66 (HIPAA Security Rule Implementation)
- **Centralized Log Collection**: Aggregate logs in a secure, centralized location.
- **Tamper Detection**: Use digital signatures or hash functions to prevent and detect tampering.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities, as per NIST SP 800-92.
- **HIPAA-Specific**: For ePHI, encrypt logs and implement strict access controls per NIST SP 800-66 guidelines.

### PCI-DSS Requirement 10 and Requirement 12
- **Audit Trail Creation**: Capture access and activity logs for systems handling cardholder data (CHD).
- **Log Retention**: Retain logs for at least 1 year, with 3 months readily accessible.
- **Time Synchronization**: Use NTP for consistent timestamps across systems handling CHD.
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for quick response to incidents involving CHD.

### HIPAA Security Rule (Healthcare Data)
- **Audit Controls**: Log and review access to ePHI, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Access Monitoring**: Track access to logs containing healthcare data.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt logs containing sensitive healthcare data, per HIPAA standards.

### SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria
- **Access Control**: Implement RBAC and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for log access.
- **System Operations**: Continuously monitor logs for anomalies and suspicious activities.
- **Change Management**: Track all changes to logging configurations.

### GDPR Requirements
- **Data Minimization**: Log only essential data to avoid excessive data storage.
- **Right to Access**: Enable individuals to request access or deletion of their personal data within logs.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt logs to protect personal data, particularly during storage and transmission.
- **Access Restrictions**: Use RBAC to restrict log access.

### CIS Controls and SANS Logging Best Practices
- **Centralized Log Management**: Aggregate logs into a secure, centralized system.
- **Integrity Checks**: Apply hashing to detect tampering.
- **Immutable Storage**: Use WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage where possible.
- **Real-Time Alerting**: Set up automated alerts for suspicious activity.

## 2. Comprehensive Logging Controls for Sensitive Data

### A. Log Collection and Centralization
1. **Centralized Log Aggregation**: Collect logs from all systems into a central repository.
2. **Real-Time Logging**: Use tools to send logs in real-time to prevent data loss.

### B. Data Integrity and Tamper Resistance
1. **Hashing and Digital Signatures**: Use cryptographic hashes or digital signatures on logs for integrity verification.
2. **Immutable Storage**: Implement WORM storage to prevent modifications.

### C. Access Control and Authentication
1. **RBAC and MFA**: Enforce role-based access and MFA for logging systems.
2. **Restricted Access for Sensitive Logs**: Limit access to logs containing sensitive data (PII, CHD, ePHI).

### D. Log Encryption and Confidentiality
1. **Encryption**: Encrypt logs at rest and in transit.
2. **Secure Transmission**: Use TLS or VPNs to secure log transmission.

### E. Retention and Secure Disposal
1. **Retention Policies**: Define log retention based on regulatory requirements.
2. **Secure Disposal**: Use secure deletion techniques for logs past their retention period.

### F. Monitoring, Alerting, and Anomaly Detection
1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for unusual activities.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Use behavioral analytics to detect anomalies early.

### G. Time Synchronization
1. **NTP**: Sync log timestamps using Network Time Protocol (NTP).

### H. Audit and Incident Response
1. **Periodic Log Review**: Regularly review logs to identify anomalies.
2. **Incident Response Readiness**: Implement an incident response plan focused on CHD and ePHI.

## 3. Sample Checklist for Logging Compliance

- [ ] **Centralized Log Collection**: Collect logs in a secure, centralized repository.

## 4. Conclusion

This document consolidates logging controls across major security standards, focusing on secure log collection, storage, access, monitoring, and disposal. Organizations managing sensitive data should follow these practices for compliance, data security, and audit readiness. Regular audits, updates, and continuous monitoring are recommended for maintaining compliance and security.
